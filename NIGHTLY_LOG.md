# Nightly Log

## 2026-06-11 23:50 Asia/Shanghai

Phase 1 was started manually for the nightly automation handoff.

Completed:

- Checked `C:\Users\22304\ai-portfolio-automation`.
- Confirmed GitHub CLI authentication for `Zhi-Chao-PAN`.
- Confirmed `Zhi-Chao-PAN/launchlens-ai` did not exist before project setup.
- Created the initial Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind project.
- Added LaunchLens planning docs.
- Added a first usable AI SaaS workspace interface.
- Added mock provider support and optional OpenAI-compatible provider support.
- Verified `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and `npm audit --audit-level=moderate`.
- Verified local HTTP page response and mock `/api/generate` response on port `3002`.
- Created the public GitHub repository and pushed the `main` branch.

Handoff:

- Keep the project status as early-stage until persistence, editability, export, tests, and README screenshots exist.
- Prioritize provider tests and editable workspace sections next.
- Do not commit secrets. The app must remain runnable without provider keys.

Notes:

- The in-app Browser could not access `localhost:3002` because of enterprise network policy, so verification used local HTTP requests instead.
